# Graph Dependent Implicit Regularisation with Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent.
This code is to accompany the manuscript "Graph-Dependent Implicit Regularisation for Distributed Stochastic Subgradient Descent" by (2020) by D. Richards and P. Rebeschini (http://jmlr.org/papers/v21/18-638.html).
The code included within the Jupyter notebook provides the functions as well as a sample experiment, for the experiments presented within the manuscript. 
Specifically, applying Distributed stochastic Gradient Descent to a Logistic Regression problem with simulated data.
